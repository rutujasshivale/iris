# iris-flower-classification
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species.

Iris virginica


The purpose of this research we can classify the new flower belonging to one of three classes (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginia) using iris Data set by applying various data analysis techniques and using various python libraries. Also we can use Petal Length and Petal Width as the classification feature. The Setosa species is the most easily distinguishable because of its small feature size. The Versicolor and Virginica species are usually mixed and are sometime hard to separate, while usually Versicolor has average feature sizes and virginica has larger feature sizes.
